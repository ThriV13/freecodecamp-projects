                From her earnings she is able to finance her sister Bronislawa’s
                medical studies in Paris, France, with the understanding that
                Bronislawa will in turn later help her to get an

                element uranium gives off unusual rays of energy. He passes his
                findings on to Marie, who begins studying the phenomenon, which
                she later names radioactivity. In 1898 the Curies announce their
                discovery of two new elements, radium and polonium. They name
                polonium after Marie’s homeland of Poland.</small

                Physics for the discovery and research of radioactivity. Marie
                is the first woman to receive the honor. (In submitting its
                nomination to the Nobel committee, the French Academy of
                Sciences had not acknowledged Marie’s contributions and omitted
                her name, but it was later put forward after Pierre insisted
                that they be considered for the prize together.)</small
